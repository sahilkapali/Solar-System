# üåå Solar System Simulation

This is a **3D Solar System Simulation** written in **C++** using **OpenGL** and **GLUT**. It visually represents the Sun and 8 orbiting planets, complete with orbit paths, self-rotation, and orbital movement. Users can interact with the simulation using the mouse and keyboard for zoom and view rotation.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Realistic 3D visualization of the Sun and planets  
- Individual orbits and self-rotations for each planet  
- Zoom in/out using mouse scroll  
- Rotate view by dragging with the left mouse button  
- Speed control using arrow keys  
- Pause/resume animation (toggle-able in the code)

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run this simulation, you'll need:

- C++ compiler (G++, Clang, etc.)
- OpenGL and GLUT libraries installed

For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```
Windows:
Install FreeGLUT

Use an IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or compile with MinGW
